Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of easy difficulty (for people who are just starting -- I'm doing them anyway).

These include:

- **Coffee Machine:** Simulate a real-world coffee machine
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** The game
- **Simple Chatty Bot:** Simple bot
